# Alcohol_detection
This project focuses on developing an alcohol detection system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a gas sensor sensitive to alcohol vapors. The system is designed to detect the presence of alcohol in the surrounding environment and trigger appropriate alerts.

The Alcohol Detection Using Arduino project aims to enhance safety by detecting alcohol in the air. The gas sensor provides analog data to the Arduino Uno, which processes the readings and triggers alerts when alcohol concentration exceeds a specified threshold.

Components
Arduino Uno microcontroller
Alcohol gas sensor
Breadboard and jumper wires
LEDs and resistors (for alerts)
Power source
Setup and Configuration
Connect the alcohol gas sensor to the Arduino Uno using appropriate jumper wires and a breadboard.

Configure the connections according to the datasheet of the gas sensor.

Set up the LEDs and resistors to act as alerts for alcohol detection.

Connect the Arduino Uno to a power source.

Usage
Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

Power on the Arduino Uno.

The gas sensor will continuously monitor the surrounding air for alcohol concentration.

If alcohol is detected above the set threshold, the LEDs will illuminate to alert the user.
